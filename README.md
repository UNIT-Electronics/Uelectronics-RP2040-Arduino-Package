RP2040 Arduino Package Index JSON

DualMCU Arduino core is a ported version of the [Raspberry Pi Pico Arduino Core](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico) based on the great work of earlephilhower Earle F. Philhower, III. This port of the RP2040 uses the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK and a custom GCC 10.3/Newlib 4.0 toolchain, the same as earlephilhower [version 2.6.4](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico/releases/tag/2.6.4).

# Documentation
See https://github.com/UNIT-Electronics/DualMCU along with the examples for more detailed usage information.

# Supported Boards
* DualMCU RP2040
* Raspberry Pi Pico
* Raspberry Pi Pico W
* Generic (configurable flash, I/O pins)

# Installing via Arduino Boards Manager

Open up the Arduino IDE and go to File->Preferences.

In the dialog that pops up, enter the following URL in the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field:

https://github.com/Rabadan-uelectronics/DualMCU-RP2040-Arduino-Package/releases/download/v1.0.0/package_DualMCU_rp2040_index.json

# Uploading Sketches

To upload your first sketch, you will need to plug the USB-C cable into the DualMCU, move the mechanical USB selector to the “A” position (see section: 3.11 Mechanical selector for the USB Communication of the [Product Reference Manual](https://github.com/UNIT-Electronics/DualMCU/blob/main/DualMCU(Product%20Reference%20Manual).pdf) and press and hold the RP2040 reset button (PB1), you can find it onboard with the label  “RST”

Without release the RESET, with the other hand, press and hold the RP2040 boot button (PB2) labeled “BOOT”

Then hit the RST and BOOT buttons and the sketch should be transferred and start to run.
